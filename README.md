LiteSync
========
Open, extensible home automation system built upon the Raspberry Pi platform. Initial prototype focused on dynamic in-home lighting. Users can calibrate the sensitivity of ambient light to control other free standing lights in the home or schedule vacation timers.

Users can configure the platform via the web.

Winner of hackCooper's best hardware hack category.

Current functionality:
  - Calibrate light sensitivity
  - Set a timer


Also, we apologize for those trying to follow the commit history and getting lost or confused. Programming at a hackathon is not condusive to good commits; we often found ourselves having to submit single lines of code to quickly test and fix problems we encountered. We also weren't very descriptive with the naming because since we didn't always submit significant changes, it was hard to actually add messages. It was frequently the case where a commit name is the last thing we laughed at, our frustrations, what was physically going on in the room at the time, the same exact thing as the last commit, et cetera. If we revist this in the future (and we might), we'll have more time to actually push significant changes with proper commit messages and what not.
